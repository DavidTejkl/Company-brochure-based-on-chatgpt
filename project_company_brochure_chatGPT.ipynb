      "Czech startup Vexl and Vexl Foundation, both part of the SatoshiLabs group, are launching their own digital mobile app marketplace called the Freedom Store. This new platform is designed for iOS users in the European Union who want greater control over their devices. The Freedom Store offers access to open-source applications, including Bitcoin wallets and e-cash tools. It also targets tech-savvy users seeking free, unrestricted access to apps. The mission of the Freedom Store is to continue the work of the Vexl Foundation in protecting financial and digital freedom.\n",

This allows users to install apps outside the official App Store, bypassing Apple’s censorship, tracking, and the risk of their favorite apps disappearing overnight. Our focus is primarily on open-source applications that support personal freedom and sovereignty in various ways - such as Bitcoin wallets, e-cash solutions, and applications for the Nostr protocol. For us, this is another important step toward greater digital freedom,\"\n",

The Vexl Foundation is also responding to a new regulatory opportunity in the European Union, which now permits alternative app distribution outside of the App Store. The Czech non-profit organization intends to seize this moment to promote freedom, privacy, and technological independence.\n",

      "Czech startup Vexl and Vexl Foundation, both part of the SatoshiLabs group, are launching their own digital mobile app marketplace called the Freedom Store. This new platform is designed for iOS users in the European Union who want greater control over their devices. The Freedom Store offers access to open-source applications, including Bitcoin wallets and e-cash tools. It also targets tech-savvy users seeking free, unrestricted access to apps. The mission of the Freedom Store is to continue the work of the Vexl Foundation in protecting financial and digital freedom.\n",
      "‍\n",
      "The Freedom Store\n",
      "was created in response to the growing centralization of power in the digital space. The project emphasizes user sovereignty and independence by providing practical tools that help individuals preserve their freedom in an increasingly controlled online environment.\n",
      "‍\n",
      "\"We are launching the Freedom Store in collaboration with AltStore.io, a platform also used by companies like Epic Games. This allows users to install apps outside the official App Store, bypassing Apple’s censorship, tracking, and the risk of their favorite apps disappearing overnight. Our focus is primarily on open-source applications that support personal freedom and sovereignty in various ways - such as Bitcoin wallets, e-cash solutions, and applications for the Nostr protocol. For us, this is another important step toward greater digital freedom,\"\n",

      "Enabling users to download apps from outside the App Store\n",
      "‍\n",
      "The development of this open digital marketplace aims to give people access to software that might otherwise be banned or restricted. The Vexl Foundation is also responding to a new regulatory opportunity in the European Union, which now permits alternative app distribution outside of the App Store. The Czech non-profit organization intends to seize this moment to promote freedom, privacy, and technological independence.\n",
      "‍\n",
      "\"I’m proud that we’ve managed to turn years of frustration over the deeply imbalanced and unsolicited struggle with Apple into a productive solution - one that can also benefit other apps in our industry. The Freedom Store is a natural extension of the Vexl Foundation’s mission. While Vexl focuses on censorship-free, KYC-free peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading, the Freedom Store brings that philosophy to the realm of software distribution,\"\n",

      "Trezor\n",
      "2 min read\n",
      "Users can now safely and intuitively strengthen their bitcoin privacy within the Trezor environment\n",
      "‍\n",
      "Trezor\n",
      ", the original bitcoin hardware wallet company, today rolled out the coinjoin feature for its devices allowing users to more easily enhance privacy and security on bitcoin transactions. Coinjoin is a process where users send their bitcoin as part of a large collaborative transaction and receive the same amount back, but with the transaction history obscured. Users’ balances and transaction history are then hard to track on the otherwise fully-transparent bitcoin blockchain. The feature is possible thanks to Trezor’s collaboration with Wasabi Wallet, the privacy-focused bitcoin wallet that specializes in coinjoin.\n",
      "‍\n",
      "Trezor is the first and only hardware wallet to enable coinjoin transactions within a hardware wallet environment. The function is now live on Trezor Model T and Trezor plans to enable coinjoin for Model One in the near future. Coinjoin is the latest addition to a host of features found on Trezor devices for enhancing security and privacy, such as Tor, coin control, and Shamir backup.\n",
      "‍\n",
      "Matěj Žák, CEO of Trezor, explained:\n",
      "“Trezor values privacy as an individual’s most important asset. Consequently, we’re delighted that we’ve found a way for our community to keep their bitcoin history private. Our coinjoin solution in Trezor Suite is intuitive and safe, making bitcoin privacy more accessible to the general public.”\n",
      "‍\n",
      "Real use-cases\n",
      "The coinjoin approach tackles a number of glaring privacy issues resulting from the inherent transparency of the bitcoin blockchain. For example, when people use exchanges, it’s easy to draw a link between their real-world identity and their bitcoin addresses. Exchanges can track user transactions even after they withdraw, and can share this data with third parties. Through obscuring transaction histories, coinjoin prevents such surveillance.\n",
      "‍\n",
      "Secondly, coinjoin offers welcome additional protection when using bitcoin for purchases. Ordinarily, merchants receiving bitcoin payments can see the total balance of an address from which the payment was sent, which some people consider an unacceptable breach of privacy. With coinjoin, users can safely break up their bitcoin balance into small amounts with no transaction history so as to obscure their total balance, like swapping a large dollar note for smaller denominations.\n",
      "‍\n",
      "A third coinjoin benefit is in safeguarding privacy for donations made using bitcoin. By default, all bitcoin transactions can be analyzed and in some cases, real-world identities can be linked. This can put non-governmental organizations and their donors in great danger, especially under authoritarian regimes. Coinjoin protects the transactions of donors and recipients, and therefore, improves the safety of organizations and their supporters.\n",
      "‍\n",
      "Matěj Žák further elaborated:\n",
      "“People who want to make private transactions can use cash without leaving any digital footprint, and without the need for the counterparty to store our identity. No one gets to see how much money they have left in their wallet or bank accounts. Trezor with coinjoin brings a similar level of privacy to bitcoin, with one click. The security of the process and ease of use help deliver privacy to a wider audience, which is one of the core values of the bitcoin community.”\n",
      "‍\n",
      "“Making bitcoin privacy tools easy to use and secure is essential, as this is what drives people to use products, which increases the privacy for everyone. That’s why we see Trezor’s integration of coinjoin as such a major milestone. A coinjoin is inherently non-custodial, and now for the first time coinjoin transactions can be signed with the keys on a hardware wallet. This is a major security improvement,”\n",
      "says Max Hillebrand, contributor to Wasabi Wallet and CEO of zkSNACKs. (zkSNACKs is the company sponsoring the development of Wasabi Wallet and operates the coinjoin coordinator)\n",
      "‍\n",
      "How does it work?\n",
      "With the Model T, Trezor users can now see a new coinjoin account type in their Trezor Suite, and simply click on the “anonymize” button. Users then choose the number of coinjoin rounds — with every round increasing the level of privacy — confirm their choices on the Trezor device, and then leave the Trezor connected with the Trezor Suite running. The rest of the coinjoin process is automated and requires no active user participation. The time needed to complete the coinjoin depends on the number of rounds - one round takes approximately 10 minutes. After completing the procedure, users will receive a confirmation dialogue with the transaction details. The fees for the transaction consist of the coordinator fee of 0.3% of the coinjoined amount and a network mining fee. The coordinator fee is paid just once, and for further remixes users pay only the mining fee.\n",

      "‍\n",
      "Demand planning is also highly complex.  Spikes occur in response to bear-to-bull market fluctuations.  They have also followed the consumer interest in cryptocurrency self custody, a demand that was sparked by the high profile implosion of centralized exchanges like Celsius, FTX and BlockFi in Q3 2022. During the same period Trezor saw a 300 per cent increase in sales of its hardware wallets for example.\n",

In the Trezor Suite Trade section, a \"Save into Bitcoin\" button opens a specially designed minimalist interface in a click. Users then fine-tune the amount of Bitcoin to purchase and how often in a way that suits their personal budget. A linked bank account converts US dollars to Bitcoin automatically, and the purchased coins are sent directly to the user's non-custodial Trezor hardware wallet. This eliminates both exposure to vulnerable custodial solutions and manual, fee-incurring steps to move purchased coins to self-custody.\n",

So we took on the development of a transparent secure chip ourselves and believe that the next model of the Trezor will have an open source chip from Tropic Square.

Like many other technology companies, this follows a trend that brings faster innovation through the community and reduces reliance on third-party know-how. The startup works on the assumption that the traditional closed-source approach hides drawbacks by closing itself off from the world, where small, closed teams work on their development and the resulting implementation cannot be verified by the chip user. Manufacturers of specialist security chips force their clients to sign NDA contracts. If its user discovers a problem, it is not possible to simply publish the finding, and thus warn about the possibility of a security risk.\n",

This new platform is designed for iOS users in the European Union who want greater control over their devices. The Freedom Store offers access to open-source applications, including Bitcoin wallets and e-cash tools. It also targets tech-savvy users seeking free, unrestricted access to apps. The mission of the Freedom Store is to continue the work of the Vexl Foundation in protecting financial and digital freedom.\\n\\u200d\\nThe Freedom Store\\nwas created in response to the growing centralization of power in the digital space. The project emphasizes user sovereignty and independence by providing practical tools that help individuals preserve their freedom in an increasingly controlled online environment.\\n\\u200d\\n\"We are launching the Freedom Store in collaboration with AltStore.io, a platform also used by companies like Epic Games. This allows users to install apps outside the official App Store, bypassing Apple’s censorship, tracking, and the risk of their favorite apps disappearing overnight. Our focus is primarily on open-source applications that support personal freedom and sovereignty in various ways - such as Bitcoin wallets, e-cash solutions, and applications for the Nostr protocol. For us, this is another important step toward greater digital freedom,\"\\nsays\\nLea Petrášová, CEO of Vexl and President of the Vexl Foundation\\n.\\n\\u200d\\nEnabling users to download apps from outside the App Store\\n\\u200d\\nThe development of this open digital marketplace aims to give people access to software that might otherwise be banned or restricted. The Vexl Foundation is also responding to a new regulatory opportunity in the European Union, which now permits alternative app distribution outside of the App Store. The Czech non-profit organization intends to seize this moment to promote freedom, privacy, and technological independence.\\n\\u200d\\n\"I’m proud that we’ve managed to turn years of frustration over the deeply imbalanced and unsolicited struggle with Apple into a productive solution - one that can also benefit other apps in our industry. The Freedom Store is a natural extension of the Vexl Foundation’s mission. While Vexl focuses on censorship-free, KYC-free peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading, the Freedom Store brings that philosophy to the realm of software distribution,\"\\nadds\\nPetrášová\\n.\\n\\u200d\\n---\\nhttps://freedomstore.io/\\n\\u200d\\nAbout Vex'"
