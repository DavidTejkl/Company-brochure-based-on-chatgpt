# Company-brochure-based-on-chatgpt
The main goal of this project is to simplify the process of creating company brochures. Instead of manually browsing websites and copying information, this tool automatically visits a given URL, extracts relevant content, and then uses a large language model (LLM) to create a summary brochure.
